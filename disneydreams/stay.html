                <h2>Where to Stay When Traveling to Disneyland</h2>
                <p>Booking a place to stay is probably one of the first things that comes to your mind when you are planning your trip. There are tons of options in Anaheim, and on Disney property. The Disney hotels can be pricey, but your stay gives you early access to rides. This can be a game changer is you are going during a busy time of year since most people are not staying on Disney property.</p>

                <h2>Non Disney Hotels Close to the Parks</h2>
                <p> There are many other hotels just a short walk away from the park entrances. Though these will not give you early park access, they are still convenient enough to walk back to if you need to take a break in the middle of the day.</p>

                <h2>Hotel Options That are Farther Away</h2>
                <p>Finally, you can book a hotel in a neighboring city. These tend to be cheaper, but that also means you will have to drive to Disneyland and pay for parking. There are parking packages available, but plan on spending around $60 a day for parking. All options have their pros and cons.</p>
