        Crowds When you are planning your Disneyland vacation, you may be wondering what the best time of the year to go is, and that kind of depends. If you are looking to avoid crowds, we suggest not going around any major holidays or long weekends. We typically like to avoid the whole month of April since most schools in the nation are out for spring break. January 10th-March 15th is one of the biggest down seasons, because the Christmas festivities at Disneyland just ended, and California tends to be a little cooler and wetter during this time.
If you want to go to Disneyland during one of the crowded times mentioned above, thatâ€™s ok! There are certain things that you can do to make your day just as magical and fun for the family. 
Going early tips One important thing is to get to the parks early, like at least one hour early. This not only gives you time to grab some breakfast, it also gives you time to get some shopping done early so you can focus on the rides later. 
Genie + Another thing we suggest is using Genie +. I know there can be some mixed reviews about this, but it can save a lot of time. It is available to purchase once you arrive in the park, so if you come earlier, you have another advantage, and you can start to book the rides that you want to go on. Not every ride has a Genie + option, so we suggest you ride those as soon as they open.

      <h3>Where to stay</h3>
      <p>
        Disney hotels Booking a place to stay is probably one of the first things that comes to your mind when you are planning your trip. There are tons of options in Anaheim, and on Disney property. The Disney hotels can be pricey, but your stay gives you early access to rides. This can be a game changer is you are going during a busy time of year since most people are not staying on Disney property. 
Hotels close to the parks There are many other hotels just a short walk away from the park entrances. Though these will not give you early park access, they are still convenient enough to walk back to if you need to take a break in the middle of the day. 
Far hotels Finally, you can book a hotel in a neighboring city. These tend to be cheaper, but that also means you will have to drive to Disneyland and pay for parking. All options have their pros and cons.

      </ul>
      <h3>Food</h3>
      <p>
        Food Reservations There are many dining options in magic kingdom, California Adventure, and Downtown Disney. The nicer restaurants do require reservations, and they do fill up very quickly. If you are hoping to score one, you must get your park tickets in advance and wait for the reservation to open. Right now, they are only booking two months in advance, and you have to wait for any future dates to be released. 
No reservations If you are looking for a place without reservations, Disney offers many other options. During meal hours the lines at more popular places can get long, but if you have the Disney app there is a mobile order option that you can use. They notify you when your food is ready to pick up, and it can save you time you might have spent standing in line. 
Seasonal treats No matter what time of year you go, there are often seasonal treats that you can enjoy all over the parks. Some of the most common places you can find these treats are: Jolly Holiday, the Mint Julep Bar, and Mainstreet USA. There are also food carts all over that have a variety of different drinks and treats.
