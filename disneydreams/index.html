            <h2>When are the best times to go to Disneyland?</h2>
            <p>When you are planning your Disneyland vacation, you may be wondering what the best time of the year to go is, and that kind of depends. If you are looking to avoid crowds, we suggest not going around any major holidays or long weekends. We typically like to avoid the whole month of April since most schools in the nation are out for spring break. January 10th-March 15th is one of the biggest down seasons, because the Christmas festivities at Disneyland just ended, and California tends to be a little cooler and wetter during this time. If you want to go to Disneyland during one of the crowded times mentioned above, thatâ€™s ok! There are certain things that you can do to make your day just as magical and fun for the family. Going early tips One important thing is to get to the parks early, like at least one hour early. This not only gives you time to grab some breakfast, it also gives you time to get some shopping done early so you can focus on the rides later. Another thing we suggest is using Genie +. I know there can be some mixed reviews about this, but it can save a lot of time. It is available to purchase once you arrive in the park, so if you come earlier, you have another advantage, and you can start to book the rides that you want to go on. Not every ride has a Genie + option, so we suggest you ride those as soon as they open.</p>
