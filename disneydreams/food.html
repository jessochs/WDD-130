        <h2>Dining Options</h2>
        <p>There are many dining options in magic kingdom, California Adventure, and Downtown Disney. The nicer restaurants do require reservations, and they do fill up very quickly. If you are hoping to score one, you must get your park tickets in advance and wait for the reservation to open. Right now, they are only booking two months in advance, and you have to wait for any future dates to be released.</p>

    <section class="no-reservation">
        <h2>No Reservations</h2>
        <p>If you are looking for a place without reservations, Disney offers many other options. During meal hours the lines at more popular places can get long, but if you have the Disney app there is a mobile order option that you can use. They notify you when your food is ready to pick up, and it can save you time you might have spent standing in line</p>
