    <p>Hi! My name is Jess and I am currently living in Arizona. I am working towards my Bachelors in applied technology, and I hope to go into software development.</p>

    <p>I LOVE all things Disney, and I take advantage of the fact that we only live a few hours away.</p>

    <p>I have been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ my whole life, and I served a mission in Paraguay over three years ago. I am currently a primary teacher in my ward, and I love seeing how excited little children are about the Gospel!</p>
